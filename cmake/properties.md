## Properties

---

There are a few per-target properties that you can set:

Target | Interface
--- | ---
`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` | `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`
`COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` | `INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`
`COMPILE_OPTIONS` | `INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`

Note: The properties in the left column apply to the target itself; those in the right column apply to anything that links to the target
